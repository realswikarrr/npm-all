# What is this app all about ?

This is WebApp where there npm commands and you can easily copy paste the npm commands to anywhere you want. The data is dynamically fetched from the database using tRPC

# Why did i build this ?

Because i am literally tired of copying and pasting commands from all over the internet so it will be very easy for me if i just have one place where i have all my commands so i don't need to go anywhere else for the commands.

# Tech Stack Used ?

`` Next JS ``
`` tRPC ``
`` Planet Scale ``
`` Prisma ``
`` TypeScript ``
`` Chakra UI ``

# Outcome 

I think t3 stack is easy to stack among other stack i developed applications with such as MERN. Specially tRPC makes our life so much easier for routing api's and all. All of our backend and frontend can be done within Next JS which is really good and i think i will be using this stack to build more application in future.

# Usage
